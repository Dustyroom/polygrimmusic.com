        POLYGRIM is back with his sophomore six-track EP titled Descent. This time around, producer Volodymyr Dzitsiuk has refined his sound to build a solidified and detailed representation of moments in his life. Using synthesizers to create hovering bass and delicate floating tones, fragments of percussion and thick driving beats, Descent takes you on a voyage. POLYGRIM says, "I am teaching myself to be grateful for every single moment and aware that everyone has their own descent, which makes you drop the unnecessary and keep up with what you truly love. This became the background to this recording, which perhaps has a saudade sound to it: a bit melancholic but at the same time optimistic, slightly nostalgic yet liberating, highly detailed but not without its organic flaws and hesitations."
