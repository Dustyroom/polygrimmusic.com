My name is Volodymyr, I live in Kyiv. By mixing synthesized and live elements, I try to make inspiring stories packed in fragile melodies, fractured rhythms and saturated atmospheres. All the parts are combined into worrying and touchy electronica music, walking the edges of downtempo, braindance, ambient and techno. Polygrim project was founded in late 2014. Together with my brother we had founded a small game studio [Dustyroom](http://dustyroom.com), which became the home not only to our games but also to all the music â€” game soundtracks and studio albums.
